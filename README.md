<h2> A simplified version of Image Retrieval using Relevance Feedback.</h2>
<p>The Image Retrieval Tool is a web-based application developed to retrieve images from a folder containing 100 images. This tool is built using Python and utilizes the ‘Gradio’ library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and NumPy and OpenCV for image processing. The primary functionality of this tool is to allow users to select an image from a gallery, choose a retrieval algorithm (Intensity code, Color code, Intensity + Color code and Relevance feedback), and retrieve similar images from the dataset. The relevance feedback will consider relevance inputs from user to update the weights and improve query results in the following iterations.</p>
